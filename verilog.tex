\end{lstlisting}
Command line options for single delay value simulation:
\textbf{+maxdelays, +typdelays, +mindelays}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Concurrent Behavioral Statements}\vspace{-10pt}
May execute a level-sensitive assignment of value to a net (keyword:~\textbf{assign}), or may execute the statements of a cyclic (keyword:~\textbf{always}) or single-pass (keyword:\textbf{initial}) behavior. The statements execute sequentially, subject to level-sensitive or edge-sensitive event control expressions.
\subsubsection*{Syntax}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
assign net_name = [expression];
always begin [procedural statements] end
initial begin [precedural statements] end
\end{lstlisting}
Cyclic(\textbf{always}) and single-pass (\textbf{initial}) behaviors may be level sensitive and/or edge sensitive
\subsubsection*{Edge sensitive}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
always @ (posedge clock)
        q <= data;
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{Level sensitive}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
always @ (enable or data)
        q <= data;
\end{lstlisting}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Data Types: Nets and Registers}\vspace{-10pt}
\textbf{Nets:} Establish structural connectivity between instantiated primitives and/or modules; may be target of a continuous assignment; e.g., \textbf{wire, tri, wand, wor.} \\
Value is determined during simulation by the driver of the net; e.g., a primitive or a continuous assignment. \\
Example: 
\begin{lstlisting}
wire Y = A + B;
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{Registers:} Store information and retain value until reassigned.\\
Value is determined by an assignment made by a procedural statement.\\
Value is retained until a new assignment is made; e.g., \textbf{reg, integer, real, realtime, time.}\\
Example:
\begin{lstlisting}
always @ (posege clock)
        if (reset) q_out <= 0;
                else q_out <= data_in;
\end{lstlisting}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Procedural Statements}\vspace{-10pt}
Describe logic abstractly; statements execute sequentially to assign value to variables.
\begin{lstlisting}
if (expression_is_true) statement_1; else statement_2;
case (case_expression)
        case_item_0: statement_0;
        case_item_1: begin
                statement_1_0;
                statement_1_1;
        end
        default: statement;
endcase
for (conditions) statement;
repeat constant_expression statement;
while (expression_is_true) statement;
forever statement;
fork statements join //execute in parallel
\end{lstlisting}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Assignments}\vspace{-10pt}
\textbf{Continuous:} Continuously assigns the value of an expression to a net.\\
\textbf{Procedural (Blocking):} Uses the = operator; executes statements sequentially; a statement cannot execute until the preceding statement completes execution. Value is assigned immediately.\\
\textbf{Procedural (Nonblocking):} Uses the <= operator; executes statements concurrently, independent of the order in which they are listed. Values are assigned concurrently.\\
\textbf{Procedural (Continuous):} \\
\textbf{assign ... deassign} overrides procedural assignments to a net. \\
\textbf{force ... release} overrides all other assignments to a net or a register

        specparam t_r = 3:4:5, t_f = 4:5:6;
        ((A,B) *> Y) = (t_r, t_f);      // full
        (Bus_1 => Bus_1) = (t_r, t_f);  // parallel

        (posedge clk => (y -: d_in)) = (3,4);   // edge
endspecify

\section*{Memory}\vspace{-10pt}
Declares an array of words.
\subsection*{Example: Memory declaration and readout}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
module memory_read_display();
        reg[31:0] mem_array[1:1024];
        integer k;
        initial begin
                // read contents of mem_array from 
                // a file in hex format
                $readmemh("mem_contents.dat", mem_array);
                // display contents of mem_array
                for (k = 1; k <= 1024; k = k + 1)
                        $display("word[%d]=%h", k, 
                                mem_array[k]);
        end
endmodule
\end{lstlisting}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Concurrency and Race Conditions}\vspace{-10pt}
Indeterminate outcomes result from race conditions when multiple behaviors use the procedural assignment operator ($=$) to reference (read) and assign value to teh same variable at the same time.
\subsection*{Example (with race):}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
always @ (posedge clock) a = b;
always @ (posedge clock) b = a;
\end{lstlisting}
Use nonblocking assignment operator ($<=$) to eliminate race conditions; assignments are independent of the order of the behaviors and the order of the statements.
\subsection*{Example:}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
always @ (posedge clock) a <= b;
always @ (posedge clock) b <= a;
\end{lstlisting}
Use the procedural assignment operator ($=$) in level-sensitive behaviors and the nonblocking assignment operator ($<=$) in edge-sensitive behaviors to avoid race conditions in sequential machines.
\subsection*{Example (without race):}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
always @ (posedge clock) 
        state <= next_state;
always @ (state or inputs)
        case(state)
                state_0: begin next_state = state_5; ...
                end
        endcase
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Functions}\vspace{-10pt}
May invoke another function; may not invoke a task. Executes with zero delay time.\\
May not contain delay control (\#), event control (@), or \textbf{wait}.\\
Must have at least one input argument.\\
May not have \textbf{output} or \textbf{input} arguments.\\
Function name serves as a placeholder for a single returned value.
\subsection*{Example:}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
value = adder(a,b);
...
function [4:0] adder;
        input [3:0] a,b;
        adder = a + b;
endfunction
\end{lstlisting}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Tasks}\vspace{-10pt}
May invoke other tasks and other functions.\\
May contain delay control(\#), event control (@), and \textbf{wait}.\\
May have zero or more arguments having mode \textbf{input, output, inout}.\\
Passes values by its arguments.
\subsection*{Example:}\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
adder (sum, a, b);
...
task adder;
        output [4:0] sum;
        input [3:0] a, b;
        sum = a + b;
